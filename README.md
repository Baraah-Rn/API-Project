I would like to present to you my app description.

The main idea of my app is to build a **food application**, that lets the user search for any meal recipes by typing an ingredient in the search bar.
If that happens the list of related meals will show up with the ability to see the pictures and the names of the meals, and you can check the recipe
for every meal by click on **Get recipe button** and it contain a vedio link.

The Application also contain a **Surprise me button** so if you feel your self lucky you can try it.
You can see there is a favorite feature in this application, that is mean  you can add any meal to your favorite list and remove it.

*You don't need any packages, just clone it and try it out.*

Always happy to have feedback :grinning:
